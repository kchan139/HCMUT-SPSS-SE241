# Requirement Document

## 1.1	Domain Context
The Student Smart Printing Service (HCMUT_SSPS) operates within the domain of university printing services at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT). This system is designed to streamline document printing for students in the university.

Users can upload documents, select from available printers, and configure printing options such as paper size, page count, and number of copies. The system ensures that students can print efficiently while tracking their usage through comprehensive logs that include student IDs, printer IDs, and timestamps for each print job.

The service includes a page balance management feature, providing each student with a default number of A4 pages each semester and allowing them to purchase additional pages through an integrated online payment system like BKPay. Administrators, known as the Student Printing Service Officers (SPSOs), have the capability to manage printer settings, adjust page limits, and configure permitted file types.

Automated reports on printing activity are generated at the end of each month and year, giving the SPSO insights into usage trends. All users must authenticate through the HCMUT_SSO service to ensure secure access to the system. The Student Smart Printing Service is available via both web and mobile applications.
